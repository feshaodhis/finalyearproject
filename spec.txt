Kindly note the following:
From the power side:
That is the solar and grid
We are suppose to give priority to solar pv module if it reaches the requirements I.e the amount of current and voltage...
The current sensor and voltage sensor/potential divider will indicate the amount of power consumed in the house.
We need to know the real,apparent and reactive power.
The lcd display1 acts as the display meter that indicates the number of units consumed from the grid , solar and also the one fed back to the grid.
The data can be stored in a centralised database system. And uploaded to grafana for visualisation 
The GSM module is to help with kununua tokens na kumake inquiry of the amount of power units remaining 
Hapo mahali unaona consumer unit box...yani contractors relays na circuit breakers...
Is where load selection is done...
We will have current sensors and voltage sensor or potential divider to know the amount drawn by the loads in general socket light and gas cooker c unajua each of them have CBs that have their own rating Additionally like light 5A socket 15A gas 30A. 
So yes we can have intentional blackout of socket or lights or gas depending on the user 
Alafu kwa lighting system 
Unaeza weka LDR na ultra sonic sensor kuonyesha how effective the system can be on the lighting side to control the on and off of the light
